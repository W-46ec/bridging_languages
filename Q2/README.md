For question 2, we chose to use javascript for the input, and python for the output.  To use it, try a command in the format of:

    node input.js -case kebab-case inputs/6; python output.py

The fourth argument is the case that the input will be parsed into.  In the above example, it is kebab case.  The fifth argument is the textfile that the javascript program
will read, assuming that it is one of the four cases specified in the question.
